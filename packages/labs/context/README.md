# @lit-labs/context

An implementation of the Context Protocol, that allows data to be passed down the DOM tree indirectly, without having to be passed via 'prop drilling'.

This package has graduated from labs! It is now available as `@lit/context`. This package is just a proxy that re-exports `@lit/context`. As a result, while it will no longer be updated, it will continue to work and get updates through the ^1.0.0 version range of `@lit/context`. This should reduce duplication of code while the ecosystem migrates their imports away from `@lit-labs/context`.

If you're looking at this locally or on GitHub, you can now find the README here: [README.md](../../context/README.md).

If you're looking at this online, you can also find its README on npmjs: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@lit/context
