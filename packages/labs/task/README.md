# @lit-labs/task

A controller for Lit that renders asynchronous tasks.

This package has graduated from labs! It is now available as `@lit/task`. This package is just a proxy that re-exports `@lit/task`. As a result, while it will no longer be updated, it will continue to work and get updates through the ^1.0.0 version range of `@lit/task`. This should reduce duplication of code while the ecosystem migrates their imports away from `@lit-labs/task`.

If you're looking at this locally or on GitHub, you can now find the README here: [README.md](../../task/README.md).

If you're looking at this online, you can also find its README on npmjs: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@lit/task
